## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Local Storage

Created with Vanilla JS and local storage which enables your notes to persist so you can close and exit your Happy Notes board, and when you come back to it all of your notes will still be available to view, edit, and delete.

## Optimizations

Add different sized notes with varying coloring and styling so individuals can categorize the notes. Go in and optimize use on mobile, the current version doesn't enable you to use the delete features when using it on mobile.
## Lessons Learned:

Using local storage to create persistence in the web app. Using Css to style the cards to look like sticky notes.
